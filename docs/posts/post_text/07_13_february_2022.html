Greetings to all! This week I have a lot of things to do. First, I've to write and upload new documentation about the manual insertion of exercises into the SQL database while you're doing a D1 launch. This documentation will be added in the unibotics-webserver README.md file that contains the D1/D2/D3 launching guides.
<br><br>
Other thing that I need to deal with is the recording of a videotutorial for YouTube about the steps to make a D1 launch. This video will be upload in hidden mode to the YouTube Channel and only the developers will can see it through a link that will be put in the D1 launch guide of the unibotics-webserver repository.
<br><br>
José María ask me if I could solve the problems of the new 'job practice' people with the D1 launching and help Felicidad with some dudes that she has with the exercises templates. I'm going to continue testing the D1 launch to try to find the problems that happen to them.
<br><br>
I will ontine working in the Ackermann Gazebo model to the 'Autoparking' exercise and some little issues that the pull-request of the forum button had.
