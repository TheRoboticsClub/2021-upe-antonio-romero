    Roomba robot was fixed and I added a new vertical camera to see the roof in the new Vacuum Cleaner exercise that David is making. 
    I've been thinking on some possible improves to add to the Unibotics web GUI, for example, create an event listener that receive when the mouse click on a button and 
    it changes its colour when that happened. Teleoperate button has this functionality but not the terminal and simulate buttons. This button effect could help users 
    to know when a button is active or not without the need to look the console or Gazebo Simulate windows.

    For next week I've to create the new CSS button effects in the Front-end and continue working on the circuit change problem in Follow the line exercise. 
    D1 dummy database hasn't all exercise object created, so other of my tasks for the next week is to implement that new objects in the SQL file.
