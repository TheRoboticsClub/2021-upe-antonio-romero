Hello! This is my penultimate week in JdeRobot. I helped the Telecomunications Engineering students and unibotics' users with the problems that they reports in our forum.
<br><br>
Also, I have to finish the Toyota Prius model. I was working in the Back-End part of the gazebo model, installing plugins and fixing geometry loading problems. I created the .launch and .world files that call the gazebo prius model to the exercise.
<br><br>
Finally, I want to add some documentation to the RoboticsAcademy repository about the adding/changing of models into exercises and the commands and steps to do it.
