    First part of the week was focused in finishing Gazebo official tutorials to understand the simulation environment and develop the websocket technology between
    a Python server and one javascript client. Also, I detected a bug in Vacuum cleaner exercise, this problem was reported through Unibotics Slack Group and
    in the RobotsAcademy Github repository issues page. Finally, I redacted some changes in the JdeRobot gh-pages documentation, creating a new section called Robot API 
    that group all GUI and HAL libraries information.<br><br>
    From tuesday to friday, I was working to attach a camera to the Roomba SDF model for Gazebo. This model will be implemented in a new exercise that it's in development stage.
    <br><br>Other problem in the Unibotics' exercise launching was detected and reported in the friday meeting. For the next week I have to solve a laser sensor problem 
    with the measurements in the Roomba model and modify camera inclination until 30deg.
