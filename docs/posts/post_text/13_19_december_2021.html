    This week tasks have been oriented in the implementation of the improves in the Front End i.e. darken the button when you click, change button colors depending on the state that they are, reduce margins and paddings... I have found a way to introduce some lines of code in the same so that the files can extract the information from a database and not have to repeat the code locally. This idea helps to speed up the proccess of buttons modification in the navbars.

    I changed some markdown documentation too: eliminate headers and sections, fix youtube videos links and add some instructions in D2 Doc of unibotics-webserver repository. I've been testing and trying to solve the Montreal change circuit problem and I found some interesting things relationed with the problem. At the end of the week, I made a D2 launching through the linux server machine of ETSIT Lab.
