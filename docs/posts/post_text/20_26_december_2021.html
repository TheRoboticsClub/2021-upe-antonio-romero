    This week we had only one meeting due to three non-working days in the university calendar. I had some tasks related to the front-end GUI of Unibotics webpage, 
    in order to improve the user experience and the web usability. Others points in my tasks assigment was the implementation and correction of the D1 dummy database, 
    make a D2 launching with the Linux Lab new privileges of my student account, access to the Docker container to learn how to modify some files there 
    through the terminal and continue solving the circuit change problem.

    Some changes were added to the unibotics-exercises repository with the new GUI changes, however, new points related with this task emerged in the friday meeting that 
    I'm going to add for the next week. Database was implemented in the unibotics-webserver repository. Circuit change problem persists and I continue working on it.
