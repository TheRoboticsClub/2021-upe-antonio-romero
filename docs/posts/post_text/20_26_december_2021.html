    This is Christmas week. We have agreed between José María and Manuel to stand by the work to solve the circuit change problem in Montreal after several attempts to fix it, Montreal will be available to select it despite mantaining the problem. Other task was finish the front end revamp between Unibotics and RoboticsAcademy because the scripts works different on each of the two platforms. The homogeneization of the code in the two GitHub repositories is neccesary to speed up and simplify the problems fixing process.

    The second part of the week was dedicated to change some documentation such as the RoboticsAcademy installation instructions, include user and password information in the D2 launching, put latest version of the RADI in the docker launching instructions on each exercise documentation. Also, I created a RADI image from the Dockerfile and learn how to make a D3 launching with Manuel.
