	Hi! My tasks this week were the addition of a forum menu in the navbar besides the other buttons of code and documentation, when you clicked in it, a iframe windows opens a view of the Unibotics forum to operate in it whithout exit the exercise page, this had a security problem with the NGINX server of the webpage and it couldnâ€™t be implemented yet. Also, I had finished the revamp of the Robotics-Academy repository with the help of Manuel. For next week, I have to modify the platform icons and adding new ones in SVG format.
