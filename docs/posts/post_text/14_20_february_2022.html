Hi everyone! This week I'll be focusing in the Gazebo model of an Ackermann car. First, I have to add the Toyota Prius Ackermann model to the CustomRobots repository that contains all gazebo models of the exercises, this models will be called from the .world and .launch files once the exercises have started.

The second task that I have is the creation of a label list in the Front-End of the Autoparking (specifically in the 'split b' tag) to be able to select which world do you have to load, the classic world with the old model or the new Toyota Prius world.
