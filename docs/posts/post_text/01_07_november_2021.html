    This was my third week as internship in JdeRobot. I have acquire new skills with Gazebo, a ROS Simulator very similar to the videogames graphic engines with
    which I worked years ago and it helped me to get used to the interface and how program works.<br>
    This week, the meeting with José María was wednesday at 17.30h, so I have a little bit more time to develop and finish the tasks that was entrusted to me
    las week: solve the laser measurements in roomba 980 model of Gazebo, attach a camera in the same Gazebo model for the Montecarlo Visual log exercise and made a local
    deployment D1 in my PC of the Unibotics platform.<br>

    <br>I have spent the last days of the week detecting errors in the 'Rescue people' and 'Obstacle avoidance' unibotics exercises. I found some problems
    in the code savings of the exercise and I reported it in the friday's meeting with the rest of the team. For next week I want to solve deployment D1 problems and make a local deployment.
