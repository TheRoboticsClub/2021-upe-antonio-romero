I have uploaded the new icons made with Inkscape in SVG format to be able to scale it without losing resolution. I solved other problems such as the recover of the ‘evaluate’ button  in the vacumm cleaner exercise (it was a conditionals problem). I include a new modal that appears when starts a load problem, it only was included in the unibotics-exercises repository. For the next week, I have to review the Laser Mapping exercise and fix errors.
