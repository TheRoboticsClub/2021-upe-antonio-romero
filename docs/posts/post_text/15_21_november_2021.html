    At the beginning of the week I was focused in the testing & error detection of two Unibotics' exercises: 'Autoparking' & 'Car junction'. I found some problems 
    related to the frame visor in the GUI. Canvas div doesn't adapt well in the Firefox browser, but in Chrome browsers yes. It could be related with mozilla webkit CSS configuration.

    Second part of the week I changed some headers of diferent sections in the exercise documentation posted in JdeRobot webpage and I uploaded a new modification in the D1 launch guide 
    README.md of the unibotics-server repository. I tested the exercise 'Obstacle Avoidance' again and I detected the same canvas responsive problem in Firefox.

    This week, I will be working on solve the frame visor adjust problems in the Mozilla Firefox browser and improve the responsive configuration of the GUI. In addition, I'll test some
    exercise and continue looking for the map changing problem and try to solve it.
