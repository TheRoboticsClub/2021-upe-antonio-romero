This week I had some tasks related to the usability and the fixing of errors in some exercises. I detected some problems in the Laser Mapping exercise with the play button, this button doesn't work once 'load into robot' process ends. Also, I inserted the load modal in the Robotics-Academy repository, this modal opens when the process of 'load into robot' is executing. Finally, I created a new issue with the dummy database of unibotics-webserver and I fixed it, and I continue solving the forum button security problems that blocked it due to the NGINX configuration in the Back-End part.

Finally the security problem with the iframe of the forum button is solved! So, I'm going to update the branch related to the implementation of the button and I'll do a pull-request to add this button to the webpage.
