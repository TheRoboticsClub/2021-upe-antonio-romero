    I started this week testing the Obstacle avoidance exercise and reporting user-side problems, other field that I have been working on is to solving the 
    problems with D1 launching in my PC. I have changed the steps manual for the D1 Launch and fixed some mistakes in the steps of this procedure. Other errors like
    a minimum characters help message in the sign-up page were reported.

    Wednesday, I received the task of understand and study the process of launching an excercise and the 'manage.py' management of resources and communication. 
    Friday after the team meeting, I finished the D1 launch process after Manuel told me some steps that were not specified in the project D1 guide wich I am
    going to incorporate in the documentation.

    For next week, I have to test two new excercises in wich engineering students will work: 'Autoparking' and 'Car Junction' inspired in the autonomous 
    cars sensors and systems. Also, I'll study the system stablished to change the map in the Follow line exercise to solve some detected problems in the future.
