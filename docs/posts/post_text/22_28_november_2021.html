    This was my sixth week as intern in JdeRobot. I focused this week in solve some issues like Responsive GUI in 'Obstacle Avoidance' & 'Car Junction' exercises in 
    the RoboticsAcademy & Unibotics-exercises Github repositories, change some doc titles in gh-pages branch of Robotics Academy, create a issue related to 
    the change circuit problem in 'Follow the line' exercise and solve a vectors display problem in the GUI of the 'Obstacle Avoidance' exercise in 
    Unibotics-exercises repository.

    For the next week, I have to resolve the collider problem in the roomba model that Manuel detected while was commiting my pull request, resolve the GUI 
    problem in the race circuit change and make a D2 when I have the permissions in my URJC Linux Lab account.
