Hello everyone! This week, I have to test my pull-request fixes in the Chrome navigator and in a Windows Operative System, to be sure that it works in all possible navigators and operative systems. Due to the problems that Carlos Caminero was having, I'm going to test the new D1 version, cloning the new unibotics-webserver repository and all its new updates, to try to find which is the real problem and in why it fails.

The final task that I have to deal with the cleaning and uploading of new documentation in the Robotics-Academy repository in english and continue solving the forum button issue that blocks the iframe that calls the forum web made with Discourse.
