    This was my first week as internship in JdeRobot. Last friday (15/10/2021), I had a meeting with my two internship tutors (José María Cañas and David Roldán)
    to get to know each other. In that meeting we agrees some task to do until tuesday 19th: Unibotics platform testing and investigate how WebSocket technology works.
    Along the weekend I replicated an exercise of the Audiovisual Technologies in Web Laboratory of URJC, this exercise consisted of create a websocket client and server
    in Javascript. <br>
    I also created the visual interface of my GitHub Pages repository in HTML and CSS to prepare it for the respective entries publications.
    
    <br>The first days of the week I've been testing two Unibotics' exercises: 
    <b><u><a style = "text-decoration: none; color: white;" href="http://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/exercises/AutonomousCars/follow_line/" style = "text-decoration: none;">Follow the line</a></u></b> and 
    <b><u><a style = "text-decoration: none; color: white;" href="http://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/exercises/ComputerVision/color_filter" style = "text-decoration: none;">Color-Filter</a></u></b>. 
    The main objective of this task was to familiarized with the platform and help developers to detect errors and other problems related with the user experience.
    <br>I could detect two errors in this exercises. A bad camera attach to robot object in the Follow the Line exercise and a misspelling in the Color-Filter documentation.
    First of them, was reported in the Unibotics chat in Slack with two example photos and the second was solved creating a incident in GitHub repository and correcting it
    in a new branch that later was merge with the master branch.

    Tuesday 19th we had the second meeting at 13.30h. In that meeting we talked about the advances in that days and stablish some new task like study the Gazebo
    simulator environment and improve the WebSocket Knowledge.
    Friday 22th we had the third meeting at 17.00h. Some problems in the development of the python client in the Websocket communication delayed the advance in that task.
    The tasks for the weekend were: deepen the gazebo platform, create a WebSocket client to client in two programming languages, 
    study ws_code.js & ws_gui.js files, improve blog interface and testing more exercises of Unibotics
