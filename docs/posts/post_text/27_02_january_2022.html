	I have dedicated this week to the opening of an issue with the navbar of the exercises to incorporate a button that opens an iframe that allows to embed the forum within the page of the exercise itself and to test this button in D2, externalise a modal in an html file that is imported from the exercise_base file in order to simplify the process of modifying and/or correcting errors on the modal, homogenise the source code (revamp) of the RoboticsAcademy repository with that of unibotics-exercises and study the path to source code from the front-end to the server.
