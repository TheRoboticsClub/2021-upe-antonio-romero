Hi! This is my last week in JdeRobot. I need to finish the gazebo Ackermann model of the Toyota Prius.
<br><br>
I added the .cc and .hh scripts to the CustomRobots repository to compile it in Gazebo through the Dockerfile that calls it to generate a .so file. I linked the list tag of the map selector to the .launch files of both models to load one or the other depending on the selection. Other important task that I had is the redaction of the path between the Front-End and the Back-End to change the models and the files that contains info about the launching process.
<br><br>
Finally, I modificated the HAL.py file to link it to the correct plugin of the Toyota Prius and be able to modify its velocity and position. I uploaded all the new patches to the repositories.
<br><br>

Thanks for all!!!
